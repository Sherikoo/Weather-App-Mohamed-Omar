# Weather-Journal App Project

# Author: Mohamed Omar

This weather app gets a city zip code and his/her feelings, fetch the OpenWeatherApp API with my credentials to obtain the city's current temperature, then post the data to my server and update the UI with all data (Date of today, Selected city's temperature, and user's entered feelings).
If an invalid zip code is entered, the app alerts the user.
